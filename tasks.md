ensure that tables generated are correct in terms of logic:

 - timeslots are 30 mins long so a session can take up to a maximum of 4 consecutive slots (2 hour sessions)
 - a professor cannot teach the same class twice in the same day
 - some sessions are taught in groups, such as physics and science
 - 1 hours brake in the middle (2 consecutive time slots)

OPTIMIZATIONS:
    
    Crossover functions:
        -
        -
        -

    Mating pool functions:


    population size and mutation rate:



coding standards:

    - comment on each functions and mathematical operation with explanations
    - functions from same category that exceed 5, should be copied in a seperate file then imported (crossover1, crossover2 ....)
